I implemented all Linux Kernel/Driver assignments in ASU CSE530, independently.
*   Assignment01 includes two modules: 
    *   A kernel module uses hashtable and synchronization
    *   A mprobe module can debug the previous kernel module.

*   Assignment02 includes two parts:
    *   A HC-SR04 driver module registered through miscdevice is equipped with two modes of one-shot and periodical sampling. This kernel module can operate two HC-SR04 sensors in the same time.
    *   Export HC-SR04 module to the SYSFS interface.
