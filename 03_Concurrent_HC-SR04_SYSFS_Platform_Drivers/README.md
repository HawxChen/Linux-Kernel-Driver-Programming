*   This work includes two parts:
    *   Two HC-SR04 driver instances registered through miscdevice are equipped with two modes of one-shot and periodical sampling. This kernel module can operate two HC-SR04 sensors in the same time.
    *   The part2 exports HC-SR04 module to the SYSFS interface, implemented through Platform Driver.

*   Both parts have testing programs and README.
